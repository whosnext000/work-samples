                        <p class="note"><strong>Important</strong><br />Before installing the plugin, you need to unzip the file you downloaded from CodeCanyon which contains the necessary files, documentation and more. You can even unzip it directly into your wp-content/plugins directory if you like since the file structure is already set.</p>
                        <p><strong>Here's what to do:</strong></p>
                        <p class="note">Make sure you have an FTP client installed on your computer, <a href="https://filezilla-project.org/">FileZilla</a> is highly recommended. You'll need to use the FTP credentials provided by your host to access the files on your site.</p>
                        <ol>
                        	<li>Put all files from the ProFolio folder in your wp-content/plugins folder.<br /><figure><img src="images/screen1.jpg" align="" /></figure></li>
                            <li>Login to your Wordpress install (eg: yoursite.com/wp-admin).</li>
                            <li>Once logged in, navigate to p Plugins > Installed Plugins.  ProFolio will be listed but greyed out (meaning it's not active).<br /><figure><img src="images/screen2.jpg" alt="" /></figure></li>
                            <li>Click Activate to start using the plugin.  You may be asked to enter your FTP credentials, your host should have provided that to you.</li>
                            <li>Look in the navigation panel for ProFolio.<br /><figure><img src="images/screen3.jpg" alt="" /></figure></li>

                        <p>Adding a project to your portfolio is fairly simple and straight forward.  Most sections will have a tooltip with examples to make it even easier to understand.</p>
                        <p>Your Add Projects page will look like this:</p>
                        <figure><img src="images/Add Projects.png" alt="" /></figure>
                        <ol>
                        	<li>Your <strong>Project Title</strong> can be anything you want with any length.</li>
                            <li>The <strong>Project Type</strong> can be anything from Web Design to Buisiness Plans to Criminal Cases.  ProFolio is not limited to those in the web industry, it can even be used to list products for sale. In this case, Project Type would be like your product categories.</li>
                            <li><strong>Add a logo</strong> to identify the project or an image for the brand of product you're selling. For best results, your image should scale easily to a max width of 250 pixels and no more than 78 pixels in height.</li>
                            <li>The <strong>Project Screenshot</strong> should be the best image that shows off the product or project.  Similar to the logo, this image should scale easily to a maximum of 250 pixels in width and no max height.</li>
                            <li>The <strong>Project Description</strong> should be as detailed as possible. Auto-formatting has been removed to allow maximum editability by using simple HTML tags such as <xmp><p></xmp>, <xmp><br /></xmp> and others.<br /></p>
                            <li><strong>NEW</strong> - Turn On/Off <strong>Show Excerpt</strong> which will appear under the projects thumbnail.  It's limited to 100 characters for now but as a highly requested feature, we threw it in for good measure.<br /><figure><img src="images/screen5.png" alt="" /></figure></li>
                            <li>The <strong>Project Technologies</strong> section is used to let your viewers know what technologies were used during the creation of your project.  This can be HTML, PHP, CSS, ASP, etc.  It is recommended that your separate each item with a pipe "<xmp>|</xmp>" for easiest readability and so that they're read correctly in the front-end should you choose to use this section as a filter.</li>
                            <li>The <strong>Client Name</strong> can be any client that you've added to the <strong>Manage Clients</strong> section.</li>
                            <li><strong>Project URL</strong> is the website address to the viewable project, whether on your site or elsewhere.</li>
                            <li>The <strong>Project Year</strong> is the date in which the project was finished.</li>

                    	<h3 id="settings">Settings</h3>
                        <p>Here's where the magic is.  In the <strong>Settings</strong> section, you get various options for customizing the portfolio to look and feel the way you want, such as:</p>
                        <h4>General Settings</h4>
                        <figure>
                        	<img src="images/screen10.png" alt="" />
                        </figure>
                        <ol>
                        	<li><strong>Select Theme</strong> is where you can select any pre-built theme or entirely create your own based off the default.css file.  <strong><i>There are 7 themes included and 1 skeleton.</i></strong></li>
                            <li><strong>Results Per Page</strong> allows you to control the pagination, so if you set it to 3 the user will be able to navigate to the next page (which uses Ajax) for every 3 items.  6 is the recommended max setting to decrease the amount of downward scrolling.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <h4>Filter Settings</h4>
                        <figure>
                         <img src="images/screen11.png" alt="" />
                        </figure>
                        <ol>
                        	<li><strong>Create a New Filter</strong> is for the title of your filter.</li>
                            <li><strong>Select the Database Column</strong> that you would like to use as a Filter for your portfolio.  <strong>Create a New Filter</strong> will overwrite the name of this column in the front end.</li>
                            <li>In the list you'll get the custom name of your filter with the database column name.  If you don't want to show a filter, it can simply be deleted.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p class="note">We decided to allow the selection of a database column to give more control over what to display.</p>
                        <h4>FancyBox Settings</h4>
                        <p>As of now there is only one setting which allows you to display the title of your project in 3 different places in the Fancybox.</p>
                        <figure>
                        	<img src="images/screen12.png" alt="" />
                        </figure>
                        <ol>
                        	<li>Outside: Displayed outside of the Fancybox container</li>
                            <li>Inside: Displayed inside of the Fancybox containter</li>
                            <li>Over: Displayed anywhere in the Fancybox container.</li>
                        </ol>

                    	<h3 id="shortcodes">Shortcodes</h3>
                        <p>As of now, there is only one shortcode you need to remember and it can be placed anywhere inside the MCE editor.</p>
                        <p>Use the following shortcode:</p>
                        <ul>
                        	<li>[portfolio]</li>

                    	<h2>Files & Structure</h2>
                        <p>After you've unzipped the files downloaded from CodeCanyon, you'll see that the file structure is quite simple.</p>
                        <p class="note"><strong>Important</strong><br />Do not edit any of the core files included in the plugin files. </p>
                        <h4>The CSS Directory</h4>
                        <p>Instead of editing the core files which you shouldn't do, you can add your own themes to the plugins css/theme directory.  Simply copy the default.css file, rename it and start styling to your hearts content.</p>
                        <p>After you've created a new theme, you can choose it in the settings.<br/><figure><img src="images/screen4.jpg" alt="" /></figure></p>
                        <p class="note">The <strong>images</strong> folder in the root is for core files.  Notice the images folder in the plugins css/theme directory, this is where to put images for your theme.</p>
                        <figure>
                        	<img src="images/screen13.jpg" alt="" />
                        </figure>
                        <p>The rest are all core files and should be left alone. Repeating this is necessary, you will overwrite any changes when upgrading.</p>
                        <h3 id="defaultcss">Understanding default.css</h3>
                        <p>If you look through the stylesheet first, it'll be easier to create your own theme.  Each element is defined with <code>#profolio-port</code> at the beginning which helps ensure maximum compatability with your site.  This practice should be continued in your custom theme for the plugin.</p>
                        <p class="note"><strong>Tip: </strong>Searching for <strong>Mobile Compatability</strong> in the stylesheet will take you to the styles required for making sure your theme is responsive and compatible with mobile devices.</p>
                        <p>All elements are commented with appropriate names so they're easy to find, such as <xmp>#profolio-port .boundingBox</xmp> is part of the <xmp>/* Layout */</xmp> section.</p>

                    	<h2>How to Update</h2>
                		<p>Occasionally there will be updates to the plugin in which case you'll want to go back to <a href="http://codecanyon.net/user/eLION/?ref=eLION">CodeCanyon</a> and download a fresh copy.</p>
                        <p>You may want to check out the <a href="http://support.elionweb.com/discussion/5/updates-change-logs#Item_3">changelog</a> to see what's new or find out what bugs have been fixed.</p>
                        <p>To update your plugin:</p>
                        <ol>
                        	<li><strong>Backup your files!</strong></li>
                        	<li>Unzip the file you downloaded from CodeCanyon</li>
                            <li>In your FTP Client, login with the FTP credentials your host provided.</li>
                            <li>Navigate to where you unzipped the downloaded files, select them all and upload them to the wp-content/plugins directory.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p class="note">Assuming you have not edited any of the core files, it is safe to overwrite all files when your FTP clients asks. <strong>Your custom portfolio themes will not be overwritten.</strong></p>

                    	<h2>FAQs</h2>
                        <p class="note">The FAQ section will be expanded online as common issues come up.</p>
                        <h4>How can I filter by price for products?</h4>
                        <p>In the section for <i>Settings > Filters</i>, you can specify the name of the filter (ie: Price). The database column you may want to use is <strong>project_year</strong> where you can simply enter the price for your product in <strong>Add Projects</strong>.</p>
                        <h4>Is it possible to change the text that says "Filter by Category", etc to something else?</h4>
                        <p>Yes, in <i>Settings > Filters</i> you can set the name for your filter in the <strong>Create a New Filter</strong> field.</p>
                        <h4>This plugin breaks my other plugins.  How can this be avoided?</h4>
                        <p>Please upgrade to version 2.0 by going to the <a href="http://codecanyon.net/item/portfolio-premium-wp-plugin/154612">product page</a> in CodeCanyon and downloading it.</p>
                        <p>Version 2.0 and beyond should be compatible with nearly all plugins.  If you find one that it breaks, please report it in our <a href="http://support.elionweb.com">support forum</a>.</p>
                        <h4>I’m not able to add clients: I receive an error “You do not have sufficient permissions to access this page”.</h4>
                        <p>This was a known issue prior to version 2.0 and has now been fixed. Please upgrade to version 2.0 by going to the <a href="http://codecanyon.net/item/portfolio-premium-wp-plugin/154612">product page</a> in CodeCanyon and downloading it.</p>
                        <h4>Some of my other jQuery plugins are not working. Why?</h4>
                        <p>Wordpress 3.5 - 3.5.1 uses jQuery 1.8.3 which has caused numerous conflicts, so in these versions, an alternate version of jQuery is loaded outside of wp_enqueue.  This may be causing conflicts depending on the order jQuery is loaded (make sure it's always the first script before any other jQuery scripts).</p>
                        <p>In versions before and beyond 3.5.x, ProFolio will revert back to the wp_enqueue to properly include the scripts.</p>
                        <h4>My design is broken.  What can I do?</h4>
                        <p>Starting with version 2.0, the styles are conditional with <xmp>#profolio-port</xmp>; the plugins wrapper, so not to conflict with other styles. Please upgrade to version 2.0 by going to the <a href="http://codecanyon.net/item/portfolio-premium-wp-plugin/154612">product page</a> in CodeCanyon and downloading it.</p>
